1. board.py : A class of the board which includes functions to check for the winner, updateing the board , printing the board and resetting the board
2. game_fucntions.py : this function is a module which includes functions that is used within the main class and noughts and crosses class. Essential this is a helper module to keep the main file as small as possible.
3. main.py: This is where the rounds are simulated for each round and where all classes are used to create the game.
4. noughts_and_crosses.py : This simulates 1 round of the noughts and crosses game untill a win and a draw has been found.
5. player.py : This player class is essential to create two players who can place a valid move on the board as well as tracking the turns of the game.
